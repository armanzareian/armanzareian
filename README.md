# Arman Zareian â€” ML Engineer & CS Grad Researcher

I build **practical ML systems** end-to-end: clean data pipelines, reliable training/inference code, and deployments that **measure, improve, and ship**.


## What I do
- **Generative & Vision ML:** diffusion models, GANs, vision transformers  
- **Data & Systems:** Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumPy/Pandas, FastAPI/Django, SQL  
- **Infra:** Docker, Git, CI/CD, REST, RabbitMQ; experience with AWS/GCP/Azure  
- **Style:** profile â†’ simplify â†’ document â†’ ship; always tie work to a metric

## Highlights (measurable impact)
- Cut backend latency by **~30%** via profiling, batching, and simpler data paths  
- Built ESP32 â†’ **Django** telemetry with real-time logging (**99.9% uptime**)  
- Analytics automation add-on that reduced manual reporting time by **~50%**  
- Publication in **_Artificial Intelligence Review_** (Springer Nature)

## Selected Projects
> Most repos are private due to NDAs/course policies. **Iâ€™ll grant temporary read access on request.**

- **Privacy-aware diffusion experiments** â€” evaluation tools for identity obfuscation vs. utility on synthetic/benchmark data  
- **IoT â†’ Web telemetry stack** â€” ESP32 firmware + Django APIs + metrics dashboard (alerts, retries, fault-tolerance)  
- **Reporting automation** â€” Scripts and backend services that turned ad-hoc reports into reproducible jobs


## Skills (quick view)
**Languages:** Python, C/C++, SQL  
**ML:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras; data prep, training loops, evaluation harnesses  
**Backend:** FastAPI, Django, REST, task queues (RabbitMQ)  
**Data:** PostgreSQL/MySQL, ETL scripts, reproducible runs (seeds, scripts, logs)  
**DevOps:** Docker, Git, CI/CD, Linux/Unix  
**Extras:** Embedded/IoT (ESP32, UART/MQTT) feeding ML backends

## Research
- Generative models (diffusion/GANs/ViTs) with a focus on **reliable evaluation** and privacy-utility trade-offs  
- Paper: **_Artificial Intelligence Review_**, Springer Nature â€” https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-023-10395-6

## Education
- **Graduate Researcher â€” Computer Science**, Kansas State University  
- **B.Sc. â€” Applied Mathematics**, Isfahan University of Technology (Faculty of Mathematics & Computer Science)

## How I work
- Write baseline first; **measure** before changing anything  
- Keep runs **reproducible** (scripts, seeds, versioned configs)  
- Prefer small, documented components that others can extend  
- Communicate with **short memos and clear charts**
